		<div class="content">Dear my lovely girls PRISTIN,  Hi hello, honestly this is the 1st time I'm writing to an artist that I really support. Being your fan from Pledis Girlz to a whole new name PRISTIN is just a blessing for me. I really like you girls, your images, your voices, your dancing skills, your visuals, your braveness in saying whatever you believe that are true to yourselves, your personalities and most importantly your skills as composer who did their debut EP themselves. For me, there are great different for a great singer versus talented singer. Great singer is an artist who surely do a great job on song that were given to them but talent singer is an artist who did their own songs, with their own colors and create a whole song for their fans including deliver the emotions themselves. That is what I'm thinking about you girls. You guys aren't just a great singer, you guys are talented singer. I never regret in listening to your album. I never regret in showing my support for you because you guys are really something else. There are many girl groups out there, but I'm still choosing you guys. I just hope you guys stay true to yourselves and comeback with a whole new album that gonna leave a great impact in the industry. I'm also really happy when we finally did it. You guys finally won a Rookie of the Year award !! Sincerely congratulations. Let's be together for a long time. I love you girls. Let's make the world know the name PRISTIN !   Sincerely, your humble fan

I miss you so much, Rena-unnie especially. I actually don't have a lot of time to watch you girls since I have a public exam  (I'm 17) this month but I did give my votes to you. Well, you did achieve it and I'm so happy. As a HIgh too, I'll make a lot of contributions to you, like fan art and subs. So, please be happy and healthy always.
